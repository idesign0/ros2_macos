## ü§ñ Navigation 2 on macOS (Apple Silicon)

Navigation2 is the advanced navigation framework for ROS 2, providing autonomous robot path planning, obstacle avoidance, and localization.
It offers lifecycle-managed components for SLAM, path planning, controller execution, and recovery behaviors ‚Äî enabling reliable, scalable robot navigation across various platforms.

This setup demonstrates Navigation2 running smoothly on macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2), leveraging Gazebo simulation, ROS 2 Humble, and native macOS tooling.

With this, you can run full mapping, localization, and navigation pipelines on Apple‚Äôs latest hardware ‚Äî opening up new opportunities for development and testing on macOS environments.

## Install Homebrew Packages  

If you don‚Äôt already have Homebrew installed (needed to install more dependencies), follow the instructions at:  
https://brew.sh/

Optional: After installing, check your system health with:

```bash
brew doctor
```

and now, Go back to the root of your workspace and run the Homebrew packages installation script:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_humble
./brew-packages/install_brew_packages.sh
```
This script installs essential tools and libraries needed for building ROS 2 Humble on macOS ARM64.

## Build the the Navigation packages:

This build focuses on nav2 and related packages only.

```bash
cd ~/ros2_humble
colcon build --base-paths src/ros-planning/ --symlink-install \
  --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=Off \
  --executor parallel \
  --parallel-workers $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
## Test Nav2 with TurtleBot4 Silulator

To get started with the TurtleBot4 simulation and Navigation2 (Nav2), refer to the official TurtleBot4 simulator demo:

### üöÄ macOS Users: Use the Patched Version for Gazebo Harmonic

Since you're on **macOS** and likely using the **Gazebo Harmonic** release, it's highly recommended to use the modified TurtleBot4 packages here:

üëâ [Modified turtlebot4 packages for macOS + Gazebo Harmonic](https://github.com/idesign0/ROS2_Humble/tree/Mac-main/turtlebot4)

These packages include:
- ‚úÖ Full support for **Gazebo Harmonic**
- ‚úÖ Fixes for **launch-related freezes**
- ‚úÖ Compatibility with **Apple Silicon** and **Xcode toolchain**

### üõ†Ô∏è Having Issues?

If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior:

üëâ First, check the **[Troubleshooting section](https://github.com/idesign0/ros2_macOS/blob/main/README.md#3-%EF%B8%8F-troubleshooting)** in the root `README.md`.  
It contains solutions for common macOS-specific issues, including build errors, launch hangs, and Gazebo compatibility problems.
